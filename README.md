# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

Fake news is one of the biggest challenges in todayâ€™s digital world. This project aims to **detect fake news articles** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.  
The notebook (`Fake news Detection.ipynb`) walks through data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Preprocess and clean raw news articles.
- Extract useful textual features.
- Train machine learning models that can classify whether a news article is **REAL** or **FAKE**.
- Evaluate models with appropriate performance metrics.
